										<p>
									  My name is Fazil Syed and I'm in team Just Do IT. I was born in Hyderabad, India,
										and raised in Melbourne, Victoria where I currently reside with my beautiful wife and two young
										boys. My hobbies are cooking, fishing, traveling, watching movies/TV shows and DJing. I can speak
										both Hindi and Urdu. My interest in IT started at a very early age, in the early 90's, and although,
										I did do some IT studies approx. 20 years ago but decided to follow a different career path. My
										interest in IT reignited recently whilst working on some IT related work projects and my own
										personal IT ideas. I felt helpless as I lacked the advanced tools, skills, and knowledge to achieve
										the desired outcome and expanding on the full potential of the work project and my personal ideas.
										My IT interest are based on the role of a Full Stack Developer, and I'm fascinated with the idea of
										automation and machine learning. These are the skills I'm hoping to gain during my Bachelor of IT
										at RMIT.<br>

										things like programming and other entertainment. When it comes to IT, I love being able to program
										my own applications and websites. Right now, the extent of my experience is basic HTML and CSS, but
										I am learning about other topics in programming that interest me such as Python and JavaScript. I also
										aim to learn many other IT skills overtime that interest me and will help me get the job I want.

									 My name is Jayden Watkins and I was born and raised in Central Queensland.
									 My main hobbies are music (listening and playing guitar/bass guitar), photography
									 (landscape, portrait, macro), building Bandai Gundam toy robots and everything Japanese
									 (food, language, travelling). My interests in IT stem from growing up in a rural
									 town having to entertain myself, starting out in video games from as early as I can
									 remember to eventually taking every IT elective in high school and building computers
									 for fun. I've dabbled in coding in the past but haven't stuck with it long enough to
									 learn unfortunately. This is one of the main reasons I enrolled in RMIT to keep me
									 focused on something I love and enjoy, and hopefully in the future I can graduate
									 and begin a life-long career in the IT field.

									 It's my pleasure to introduce myself as Mina Roh. I migrated to Australia 14 years ago
									 from South Korea and I currently live in Melbourne, Victoria. I am a working mother of two young
									 girls. I enjoy paper crafts, playing the piano, and listening to music. I am interested in all
									 areas of design. The inspiration to study IT came from studying big tech companies such as Apple,
									 Microsoft, Amazon, Tesla and Google to invest in US stocks. I became fascinated with their growth
									 and contributions to the creation of computer-generated value and prosperous technology. My particular
									 interest is cloud computing and cyber security, and I want to pursue a career in that field when
									 I graduate. At the moment, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS, but I would like to improve my
									 computer skills as well as my programming skills after completing my course.

										I am Ben Gabriel Barrios, 24 years old and was born in Quezon City, Philippines.
										I arrived in Brisbane, Australia 12th of September 2021. I love pets and I fostered a chicken,
										2 fish and 2 cats back in Philippines. My favourite pet is cat. At the age of 4, my father died
										but even though I did not have my real father my uncles and grandfather took care of me when
										my mother left for Israel so she can support us financially. My first time seeing a computer
										was when I was 8 y/old in the care of my uncle who was an IT professor in a Cagayan State University
										in Sanchez Mira, Cagayan, Philippines. That is the first time I was amazed by a device that can
										do so much. My first love was the game Zuma of PopCap Games. My love for games gave me the interest
										to pursue IT program and I hope RMIT can help me. Currently, I have basic skills in HTML and CSS
										and would like to improve to achieve my dream of becoming a Software Developer (Game Development).

									Our team's individual personality results indicate that we are quite a mix of different people who all think in our own ways. 
									This is a good thing as the variety that comes with having different thinkers will allow us to come up with more original ideas 
									together than we ever could on our own. All our individual personalities will be able to provide unique insight into ideas, 
									problems and solutions from one another allowing us to create more in-depth information and come up with very well thought out 
									solutions. The way that having a large variety of personalities will help us achieve this is by considering everyone's 
									individual thoughts, ideas, feedback, and then building on those individual thoughts as a team to come up with the best 
									solution together.

												team members would develop the programs and I would like to keep it safe. So, the ideal plan would be to acquire a
												SANS certification to learn computer security, how malware is developed, and how hackers hack. For computer systems

												A required skill set:<br>
												<br>
												<ul>
													<li>
														Java is a very popular programming language among application developers due to its unique features and performance and therefore 
														one of the most sought out skill sets. It can be used to create applications that are complete and able to run on a single computer 
														or across servers and client networks. Due to this, you can use it to build mobile applications or run desktop applications that use 
														different operating systems and servers. 
													</li>
													<br>
													<li>
														Swift is a multiparadigm, general purpose programming language which was developed by Apple inc. It's a powerful program for 
														developing iOS applications (mobile or desktop), as well as scaling up to cloud services and anything else that gets started and ran 
														with written code. It's another skillset an application developer may need as it's closely tied to iOS applications. 
													</li>
													<br>
													<li>
														C# is another general purpose, multiparadigm programming language. It was developed by Microsoft in 2001 and provides modern day 
														developers to have flexibility and features to build software that will work for many years to come. In comparison to Java, it 
														performs better on Android due to design language choices and runtimes. It's an important skill to learn as it's another way for 
														application developers to create software effectively. 
													</li>
													<br>
													<li>
														JavaScript. Many developers use JavaScript more than most other programming languages as it is well suited for mobile application development. It 
														can be used across platforms such as iOS, Android and windows. It is one of the core technologies when it comes to web development 
														as well as app development and is therefore a great skill to have as an application software developer.
													</li>
													<br>
													<li>
														Windows. Being able to know your way around Microsoft windows is important for being an Applicaiton developer to understand the tool and 
														features it provides in specific programming languages. It will increase the productivity and functionality of the way the developer 
														will work by knowing their way around the operating system. 
													</li>
												</ul>

												The three highest ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set:<br>
												<br>
												<ul>
													<li>	
														SQL, Project management and 5AP are three of the highest IT-specific skills that are not in my required skill set. SQL is used to 
														communicate with a database and perform tasks such as update data on a database or take data from a database. It's not something 
														that is necessarily needed for an application developer to have as a skill set. Project management isn't something that an 
														application developer necessarily as it required to coordinate a project from start to finish and is a skill set that another person 
														might be able to possess instead of an app developer.  SAP is a software for management of business processes. It connects all parts 
														of a business into an intelligent suit on a digital platform. This may be a useful skill to learn however not necessary for 
														application developers. 
													</li>
												</ul>
											</td>
										</tr>
										<tr>
											<td></td>
											<td>General Skills</td>
											<td>
												A required skill set:<br>
												<br>
												<ul>
													<li>
														Communication is important for application developers due to being in a team environment. It is important that there are effective 
														communication skills across the board to produce a successful operating application software. 
													</li>
													<br>
													<li>
														Lots of an application developer's time will be spent identifying problems and solving bugs in a program. Being able to problem 
														solve is important for application developers to successfully provide great solutions to issues that are created thorough the 
														software development. 
													</li>
													<br>
													<li>
														When developing applications, the team is working towards a common goal of creating useable, functionable applications for users. 
														When teammates help each other out and encourage each other, this will increase efficiency of the development which will reduce

						<h2>IT Work</h2>

						<a href="interview.html" target="_blank"><u><h3>Transcript and Raw Audio</h3></u></a>

						<p>
							This interview is to get an idea of what it is like working in todays fast paced and innovational IT industry. Our interview goes over 
							multiple topics about what it is like having a job in IT with IT professional Biagio Abignano who has been working in the IT industry 
							for over ten years and has valuable insights that are beneficial to those looking to join the IT workforce.
						</p>
							
						 <h3>What kind of work is done by the IT professional?</h3>
							 <p>
								Biagio Abignano is a senior engineering manager for the startup company Bright. His job includes managing
								a team of five software engineers, giving his engineers access to pathways and education for increasing
								their skills in their field of work and ensuring software's quality through maintenance and customer feedback.
								Biagio's workplace has several tools used to maintain their software, one of those tools' records how the user
								interfaces with their applications so that they can analyze the users input and variables like how long the user
								took to do a certain task. This information helps Biagio and his team figure out how to improve and or fix their applications as needed.
							 <h3>What kinds of people does the IT professional interact with? Are they other IT professionals? Clients? Investors? The general public?</h3>
									<p>
										Biagio interacts with many different professionals throughout his company. He interacts most with his engineering team
										who create the software. The other person on his team is the product manager who he is partnered in managing the team with.
										Outside of his team is his boss, the head of engineering, P&C, which is another name for HR, the support teams who give
										him the information he relays to his engineering team and the talent acquisition who are a small team of internal recruiters
										that he interacts with a lot to help them ensure they hire the right people for the job.
									</p>
								<h3>Where does the IT professional spend most of their time?</h3>
								 <p>
									The most time-consuming aspect of Biagio's job is the delivery of new software features in which he coaches his team
									 on what to do and ensure the feature is completed by the deadline. When there are new features that his team needs to
									 create, he first must work with the engineers to break the feature down into things called tickets which are individual
									 sections of the feature which they produce linearly. The tickets have three stages they go through as the feature is created
									 those being ready for development, in development, in testing and released in that order.
								 </p>
								 <h3>What aspect of their position is most challenging?</h3>
									<p>Biagio finds that because of the switch to remote work it is difficult to ensure everyone is on the same page. For example,
										because everyone is on their own as opposed to a more collaborative environment like the office where Biagio can easily track
										and make sure his team are working correctly he instead must deal with the fact that many members of his team may work very
										differently from one another and it is extremely hard to make sure all those people are working in tandem towards a shared goal
										using the same practices and processes.</p>

						 <h2>Cyber Security</h2>
						  <p>
							 Cybersecurity refers to all actions taken to protect users' assets from risks such as information leakage, cyber terrorism, internet hacking
							 and financial accidents (Groot, 2022). Cybersecurity is necessary to safeguard sensitive information such as large amounts of collected financial
							 data, intellectual property, and personal information. As the scale of cyber-attacks increases, steps must be taken to safeguard information
							 related to national security, data of businesses and organizations, and health and financial records (Groot, 2022).</p>
							<p>
								Cybersecurity can assist corporations or organizations to corroborate that their security standards are in conformance with a procedure, policy
								or process, analyze their security advantages and drawbacks, and describe security trends throughout the institution's control. It is acknowledged
								that an organization must detect its security administration progressively and analyze changes that are essential to acclimatization in the
								institution's security position. This perquisite can be integrated to assist an organization attain its mission by assessing its acquiescence
								with regulations and legislation, upgrading the performance of applied security conduct, and replying to high grade operation questions in terms
								of security, which promote approach building by the instructions' highest quality of operation (Voeller, 2014).</p>
							<p>
								The most common tactic to protect a network is a firewall. A firewall can be a software tool, or a hardware device physically connected to the network.
								In both ways, the role of the firewall is to keep track of which network connections are recognized on ports, and to obstruct all other requests.
								Typically, a server administrator sets up and manages these firewall policies, which are coordinated by the change management process. Once hackers
								have circumvented firewalls and network security, the next line of defense is an antivirus tool that scans the hardware for malware. The goal is to
								eliminate malware before it spreads to other devices and launches attacks like ransomware (Ullrich, Cropper, Frühwirt & Weippl, 2016).</p>
							<p>
								Backup management is also fundamental to a company's cyber security strategy. Businesses should establish a disaster recovery plan to prepare for
								emergencies. If it regularly backed up all the critical systems, it could have the ability to recover from a power outage or data breach in a
								reasonable amount of time. Most existing cyber security tools require some level of human intervention and configuration. For example, IT team
								members must establish firewall policies and backup schedules, and then verify that they are running successfully (Ullrich, Cropper, Frühwirt & Weippl, 2016).</p>
							<p>
								Soon, companies will be able to handle event monitoring and incident response in bulk using smart tools. The next-generation firewall will
								incorporate machine learning, so it will be able to recognize patterns in web requests and automatically block potentially threatening requests.
								Experts also expect AI's natural language processing capabilities to play a significant role in future cyber security tools. In other words, AI
								(Artificial Intelligence) systems can scan enormous amounts of data from the Internet to learn how cyber-attacks start and suggest solutions to
								decision makers within organizations. Machine learning is also expected to expand rapidly in the security field (Thomas, 2021). ABI Research analysts
								predict that cybersecurity-related machine learning investments will increase spending on artificial intelligence and analytics to
								$38.2 billion by 2026 (Echosec.net, 2022). And some of the world's leading technology companies are using machine learning to better protect their
								customers. For example, Google uses machine learning to analyze threats on Android-based mobile devices and finds and removes malware from infected
								mobile devices. Although it is still in its infancy, it is expected to become a major technology in the future. Artificial intelligence and machine
								learning will change the way security is handled.</p>
							<p>
								AI is starting to help with cyber defense. The most obvious use cases are malicious behavior on endpoints and networks, fraud detection, or pattern
								analysis in SIEM (Security Incident and Event Management). It is expected that this IT technology will continue to grow. For example, it can be
								applied in the field of preventing service interference, identifying the cause of responsibility and correcting user behavior (Thomas, 2021).
								Machine learning-based tools excel at identifying patterns and discovering events before human users. For the time being, organizations will have
								to combine humans with these next-generation tools when implementing their cybersecurity strategies and keep an eye on new AI advances (Thomas, 2021).
								What is the likely impact? (300 words) What is the potential impact of this development?</p>
							<p>
								Passwords are essential, but they can be cumbersome. Most Internet users create their own passwords for each service or website they subscribe to online.
								Not only is this difficult to manage, but it can also leave users vulnerable to attacks if they use a simple password or use one password on multiple sites.
								The performance of password manager software has improved in recent years. They simplify and enhance online security by eliminating much of the manual
								work through algorithms that indicate and store identification that are complex enough to diminish the possibility of being hacked.</p>
							<p>
								But eventually, AI could take us to the unknown world of password-free online environments. Advances in the field of identity and access management
								(IAM) suggest that passwords will one day be replaced by intelligent AI-powered systems. In other words, AI tracks everyone in an organisation based
								on job title, authority, and universal behaviour. A second authentication is requested from the user for any deviation from the norm. For example,
								it can be biometric authentication that can scan fingerprints or facial features (Aware, 2022). Investing in cybersecurity solutions and tools is
								essential for businesses of all sizes. Businesses on a small budget might be tempted to take a shortcut and save money, but that is why they are
								often a primary target for hackers. Cybersecurity products prove their value overall by reducing their risk and protecting them from dangerous
								unknowns. The possibility is that advances in AI technology will eliminate the need for companies to maintain large cybersecurity teams within their
								IT departments in the future (Thomas, 2021). Machine learning-based tools excel at identifying patterns and discovering events before human users.
								For the time being, organizations will have	to combine humans with these next-generation tools when implementing their cybersecurity strategies and
								keep an eye on new AI advances (Thomas, 2021).</p>
							<p>
								There are times in my life when I feel insecure about the security of my information. If I use public Wi-Fi to access your bank account or personal
								information, I may be afraid that hackers will steal that information. I am also concerned that a hacker might be stealing important photo files
								stored on my computer, such as a copy of my passport information, driver's license, or documents related to my personal identity. As such,
								cybersecurity is so intimately linked to our lives that intellectual property is so important. So, the enhanced technologies mentioned above
								will protect our intellectual property and personal information and a lot of data to make our society safer. Attacks with cyberweapons can destroy
								individuals, friends, businesses, and even countries. In fact, in 2015 at a German steel company, a furnace control unit was hacked, causing great
								physical damage. At a Volkswagen plant, a robot malfunctioned and pushed a worker, causing casualties. These cybersecurity issues have not ensured
								the safety of the company and the employees who work for it. Therefore, the issue of enhanced security is an especially critical issue that holds
								 not only our individuals but also the members of society accountable to a wider extent and even the country ( HackRead,2015). But even with this
								 organizational and personal escalation of responsibility, cybersecurity incidents are like fires and cannot be prevented 100%. However, the current
								 market situation is that the field of cyber security is more subdivided, such as risk management, control and assurance, law and regulation, security
								 evaluation and audit, and there is a demand for experts who fit each element. In the future, the responsibilities of information, companies, and
								 users will be further expanded.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Government: Pursue national cyber risk minimization and support a rapid cyber ecosystem.</li>
								<li>Companies: Plan and provide services that are responsible for the safety of customers and society and expand cyber business.</li>
								<li>User: It should be possible to introduce and enjoy self-acting security and reliable services.</li>
							</ul>
						<h2>The Blockchain and Cryptocurrency</h2>
							<p>
								The concept of the blockchain derived in 1991 however, its first widespread use was along with the creation of cryptocurrency, Bitcoin (Investopedia 2022).
								The blockchain is an immutable ledger that is shared in which it facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets in a business
								network (IBM 2022). It is important for businesses to receive accurate information, fast. The blockchain is ideal for doing this as it provides instant,
								shared and transparent information that can only be accessed by network members that have permission. The blockchain is able to track information such
								as payments, orders, accounts, production and more at a high confidence level due to its transparency and end to end details of the transactions.
								This transparency allows for greater confidence within the industry involving it (IB 2022).</p>
							<p>
								What differentiates a typical database and the blockchain is how the data is accumulated and structured. Unlike a typical database, the blockchain
								ollects information together in groups known as “blocks” which hold sets of information. Once these “blocks” are filled, they are then closed and
								linked to a previously filled block, forming the blockchain (Investopedia 2022). This line of data blocks essentially created an irreversible line
								of data that becomes set in stone and part of the time-line, in turn creating an exact timestamp of when this data is added to the chain. This allows
								digital information to be recorded and distributed however, not edited, deleted or destroyed (Investopedia 2022).</p>
							<p>
								The term ‘cryptocurrency' or ‘crypto' is heavily associated alongside the blockchain. Cryptocurrency is a peer-to-peer digital payment system that
								doesn't rely on banks to verify transactions, essentially becoming decentralized (Kasperksy 2022), hence why it is often referred to as decentralized
								finance or Defi for short. Cryptocurrency has been around since 2009 with the launching of Bitcoin by an unknown person / group named Satoshi
								Nakamoto (Investopedia 2022). Ever since then thousands of cryptocurrencies have been released with each of them coming with its own utility
								benefits along with a new age of blockchain technology.</p>
							<p>
								Cryptocurrency is run on the blockchain to record all transactions made by currency holders which can be tracked.  Owning cryptocurrency doesn't
								mean you own anything tangible, what makes cryptocurrency valuable is the key associated with the unit of said cryptocurrency stored on the blockchain
								which gives it its scarcity and uniqueness (Kaspersky 2022). This, just like any other type of finance, can be transacted to another person without
								the use of another third party such as a bank (Kaspersky 2022). Crypto's main use is being a payment system, however not every crypto will have an
								underlying asset as that depends on if people are willing to pay and trade for it. This means that the price of crypto assets can flutctural at extreme
								levels due to market speculation such as media focus, public announcements or actions of individuals (Moneysmart 2022).</p>
							<p>
								As the blockchain and crypto become more popularized, businesses will begin to accept payment in this form. Many businesses in the present day have
								adopted the concept and many more will join. More than 2300 US businesses accept Bitcoin and an increasing number of other worldwide companies are
								using bitcoin or other digital assets for investment, operations or transactional purposes (Deloitte 2022). The block chain can be used for more than
								just the validation of crypto tokens for example music. Recently music streaming company, Spotify, announced its plans to join the Web3 space and
								plans to integrate blockchain technology in an effort to boost artist earnings (Weraveyou 2022). As the blockchain develops and becomes more adopted,
								the technology will be used for other big transactions such as real estate. Real Estate transactions are expensive, involve lots of paperwork and
								third-party assistance to close a deal. However, by using digital real estate tokens stored on the blockchain through tokenization, these tokens can
								be used to represent physical assets (Moneysmart 2022). This will cut out the “middleman”, provide undeniable proof of ownership via the digital ledger
								on the blockchain and improve market security. This is one of the many ways that blockchain technology can be used in the future as it improves.</p>
							<p>
								The potential impact of blockchain technology has the ability to change the way traditional businesses operate. This is done by offering greater
								transparency, increased efficiency, improved traceability, improved speed of transactions or reduced costs (The European Business Review 2021).
								There is a high chance that there is a financial and social revolution on its way which will change the way we own and transact finance currencies
								and other real life ownerships such as real estate. According to Deloitte's 2021 Global blockchain development survey, 76% of executives said they
								expect digital assets will be a strong alternative to fiat currencies in global finance within the next 5-10 years (The European Business Review
								2021, Deloitte 2021). Not only will blockchain technology impact the way we do future transactions of digital assets, it will also impact the way
								ownership is held for real life assets such as art, real estate, music and almost anything tangible. This is done through the newly developed
								oncept called ‘Non-fungible tokens' of NFTs for short. NFTs is an emerging piece of blockchain technology that revolutionized the way we buy and sell
								digital assets that represent real world items (The European Business Review 2021). All NFTs are stored onto the blockchain and therefore cannot be
								replaced nor destroyed, only traded, sold or given away by the owner.<br>Other ways that the blockchain will impact the world is through:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Improving cyber security by having all data verified and encrypted onto the blockchain.</li>
									<li>Unified communications by enabling faster and safer automated communication.</li>
									<li>Reduced government bureaucracy and increased security, efficiency and transparency.</li>
									<li>Crowd funding and donating to charities by ensuring money gets to the right place.</li>
									<li>Healthcare by having all medical information be stored in a secure centralized database.</li>
								</ul>
							<p>
								These are just a few of the many ways blockchain/cryptocurrency technology will impact society (Forbes 2018. This technology has the opportunity to
								make some jobs redundant such as potentially removing the need for real estate agents, bankers or other middle ground jobs that are reliant on
								paperwork to verify ownership or transactions. However along with the blockchain will come many new opportunities and a higher demand of skills
								within the IT world that involve managing and developing blockchain technology. (tKey 2018).</p>
						<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
							<p>
								Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence and computer science which focuses on using data and developing algorithms to imitate
								how humans learn, gradually over time improving its accuracy and precision (IBM, 2022). The term was first used by Arthur Samuel in 1959 in a
								paper which looked at analysing the possible moves in a game of checkers. Because computing power was miniscule compared to what is available
								today, checkers was ideal because the number of possible games that could be played is 10^31 compared to chess and Go's 10^123 and 10^350 possible
								moves respectively (Gabel, 2019). The relative simplicity was what made checkers a good potential to analyse for early proof-of-concept AI's.
								Samuel in his paper outlines two of the foundational learning techniques (rote learning and generalisation learning) that are still used today.</p>
							<p>
								Machine learning in its simplest form works by breaking a learning algorithm down into three main parts (IBM, 2022). A decision process in which
								algorithms are used to make a prediction or classification and based on input data from the user, the algorithm produces an estimate about the
								pattern in the data. Next an error function is introduced to evaluate the prediction of the model from the decision process. If there are already
								existing examples of the preferred outcome, the error function compares its prediction to the known outcome to assess the overall accuracy of the
								model. Finally, the model is optimised by repeatedly making changes and reassessing against the example input and estimate until a threshold of
								accuracy has been met.</p>
							<p>
								Machine learning is currently being used in a multitude of ways to assist in day-to-day tasks, product recommendations based on personal trends
								and even playing an important role in self-driving cars. Some more examples of machine learning in the real world today include such things like
								virtual assistants (Siri, Alexa, Google), traffic predictions for daily commuting, social media predictions and recommendations, email spam and
								malware filtering, search engine result refining, online fraud detection and even used in video surveillance.</p>
							<p>
								One of the technologies that will benefit machine learning soon is the further development of quantum computing technologies. Quantum computing
								would allow the performance of simultaneous multi-state operations, enabling faster data processing. In 2019, Google's quantum processor performed
								a task in 200 seconds that would take the world's best supercomputer at the time 10,000 years to complete (Zhydik, 2021). Because the basis of
								machine learning relies on the ability to process large quantities of data multiple thousands (sometimes even millions) of times, the ability
								to improve the speed at which computers could process information would greatly benefit the strength and performance of algorithms used. There
								is currently no commercially ready quantum computer readily available. However, several large tech companies are investing heavily in the research
								and development of this technology, so the rise of quantum machine learning is potentially closer than ever before.</p>
							<p>
								As outlined above, the main impacts of machine learning are the ability to streamline certain tasks, as well as making more precise recommendations
								and expanding the ability for computers to process data. However, with the recent advancements in machine learning, and artificial intelligence,
								there are some concerns with how it could potentially negatively impact industries and people. One issue is the idea of a technological singularity.
								Also referred to as superintelligence, this is the idea of AI vastly surpassing human intelligence in aspects like scientific creativity, general
								wisdom and social skills (Bostrum, 2003). In the past, this was considered only in the realm of science fiction but with the rate of technological
								innovation in the last half century, it has many people concerned although many researchers have expressed that this is an issue of non-concern.</p>
							<p>
								Another large area of concern for machine learning is the impact on jobs. There is currently a large amount of public perception around AI replacing
								jobs and making several jobs of all skill levels redundant. Companies such as IBM are suggesting that this issue should be reframed as when the market
								experiences disruptive, new technologies, the demand for specific job roles shift (IBM, 2020). For example, in the automotive industry many large car
								producers are shifting from traditional fuel–based consumption vehicles to creating electrical vehicles and machine learning should be viewed in a
								similar manner, where jobs will be shifted elsewhere instead of completely removing the need for people to work certain positions. As machine learning
								and AI capabilities expand, the need for individuals to manage these systems will grow and change every day, so there is still a need for resources to
								address more complex problems within the industries that are affected by the development of machine learning.</p>
							<p>
								With the development of these systems designed to streamline certain processes, there is an ethical question around how to protect individuals from bias
								and discrimination. In certain examples where companies have used machine learning algorithms to streamline processes such as hiring that have had
								unintended negative consequences. In 2014, Amazon had been building machine learning based computer programs to review resumes for job applicants
								searching for what they considered to be top talent. automation had been the key to Amazon's dominance in the e-commerce business with warehouse optimisation
								as well as driver optimisation (Dastin, 2018). It was made apparent not too long after however that the algorithms were prioritising men over women for
								the positions due to how the algorithms analysed the applicants over a ten-year period. Due to the tech industry being a male dominated industry, this
								unintentionally taught the system to prefer male candidates to women. Amazon had changed the algorithms to retrain these systems but there was no guarantee
								that other ways wouldn't be devised to discriminate against candidates, so the team was dismantled in 2017 as executives lost hope for the project.</p>
							<p>
								As machine learning progresses to handle more complicated tasks, there will eventually be more widespread adoption of computers making decisions for humans.
								The first example that comes to my mind of this is with Tesla's becoming more common on the roads. Tesla has already begun to implement fully autonomous
								driving in the form of the company's proprietary Full-Self Driving (FSD) systems and although this isn't available in Australia currently, it's only a
								matter of time before there will be fully autonomous vehicles driving in Australia. This sentiment is something that concerns me as it leads to possible
								scenarios, albeit very rare, in which computers will have to make split second decisions that can result in serious harm or death to the driver or pedestrians,
								or systems fail completely. In 2016, a driver was using Tesla's autopilot on a US highway and the car's software couldn't distinguish an 18-wheel truck
								while crossing lanes, causing the car to drive under the truck and crash which unfortunately ended in a fatality for the driver (Yadron, 2016).</p>
							<p>
								Fortunately, an MIT Media Lab in 2014 developed a modern, interactive version of the trolley problem to use the information to help develop further algorithms
								to add a human element to problems in which the AI systems are making these decisions. The trolley problem stems from a thought experiment in which a runaway
								trolley (or tram) is speeding uncontrollably down the tracks, about to hit several people. A lever nearby could be pulled by a bystander which would change
								the direction of the track so the people are spared but will instead cause another unsuspecting person to be hit instead. It asks the moral question of which
								is worse? Do nothing and hit multiple people or pull the lever, diverting the trolley to hit one person. The website known as “Moral Machine” over the span
								of four years logged 40 million decisions from 233 different countries to analyse how people would react to similar situations involving autonomous vehicles.
								The authors of the study emphasised that the results from this experiment would help technologists think more deeply about the ethics of AI beyond just
								self-driving cars (Awad, 2018).</p>
						<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
							<p>
								Autonomous vehicles are vehicles that have the capability to self-drive without the need of human inputs to operate the vehicle. This is achieved with the
								assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI), using multiple technologies and guides for the vehicle to manoeuvre from point A to B. Technologies include sensors,
								cameras, GPS, radar, lidar and real-time traffic management system.</p>
							<p>
								According to Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), there are six levels of automation that determine the level of human operation required to operate an
								autonomous vehicle. This can range from Level 0 where full driver operation is required to Level 5 where the operation of the vehicle is fully automated or
								self-driven. The breakdown of these six levels are as follows:<br>
								<div class="table-wrapper">
									<table class="alt">
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td>Level 0</td>
												<td>Nil Automation - Human driver must operate the vehicle</td>
												<td></td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Level 1</td>
												<td>Driver Assist - Minimal driver assistance is provided (E.g., Cruise control).</td>
												<td>First three levels have basic automation and require humans to monitor and operate the vehicle</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Level 2</td>
												<td>Partial/ Limited Driving Automation – Partial automation is provided to the driver (E.g Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS)).
													This level of automation is like the autopilot mode on an aeroplane. Humans are required to always monitor the vehicle's operation as it
													may require them to take control.</td>
												<td></td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Level 3</td>
												<td>Conditional Driving Automation – The vehicle uses automation technologies to operate. However, humans are still required to monitor
													the vehicle's operation as it may require human to take control.</td>
												<td></td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Level 4</td>
												<td>High Driving Automation – Vehicle operates autonomously in certain environment or conditions. Humans have the capability to
													override or take control as required. </td>
												<td>The last three levels have advance automation whereby the vehicle is monitored by the automated systems</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td>Level 5</td>
												<td>Self-driving/Full Driving Automation – Operation of the vehicle is fully automated and driverless in all conditions with nil
													human vehicle operation required.  </td>
												<td></td>
											</tr>
										</tbody>
									</table>
								</div>
							<p>
								Although it may seem that we've come a long way with autonomous vehicles and its technologies, it's surprising to note that well-known
								electric car manufacturer Tesla, commonly seen on Australian roads, operates only at level 2 automation. This is still a far cry from a
								completely driverless vehicle and SAE level 5 vehicle autonomy.</p>
							<p>
								However, there are some clear signs of advancements, with successful launch of companies such as Google's Waymo, which is currently
								operating as a driverless taxi service in Arizona, U.S.A. Its services are restricted to a small area of Arizona, which is well mapped out
								due to its size and with the benefit of good all year weather conditions has allowed Waymo's vehicle to operate autonomously.</p>

						<h2>IT Project</h2>
						 	<h3>Overview</h3>
							<p>
								uDecide will be a multi-platform application built to be a TV guide for all streaming services (Fazil 2022). This catalogue of 
								movies and shows will be viewed in multiple separate ways such as a home view, manual filter settings, different themes, and 
								categories, and finally a machine learning algorithm to recommend movies and shows based on the user’s preferences gathered 
								automatically through site use. On top of the different search options there will be detailed information about every piece of 
								media in uDecides catalogue. The information contained will consist of ratings from the likes of IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes as well 
								as links to trailers, reviews, and other such factors for the user to use in their decision on whether to watch the movie or tv 
								show they chose. 
							</p>
							<h3>Motivation</h3>
							<p>
								Today almost every household is subscribed to one or more streaming services (Fazil 2022). In today's world the entertainment 
								industry is so vast especially when it comes to streaming services. One of the major problems with this is that with such a 
								large amount of content spanning so many different applications, choosing what to watch turns from a way to relax into a daunting 
								task that can take any amount of time from minutes to even hours in extreme cases. This is where the idea of uDecide was born, 
								now you will not have to spend even minutes picking a movie because of uDecides recommendations and if you have something 
								particular in mind you can use the manual search to find what you are looking for. This alongside being able to see ratings, 
								reviews, and overall people's thoughts on a movie, you can always find something you will enjoy watching in a timely manner. 
							</p>
							<h3>Description</h3>
							<p>
								uDecide is a web and mobile application that contain listings for all movies and tv shows that the user is subscribed to. To 
								accomplish this the user will be able to link up their used streaming services so that uDecide knows which catalogues of 
								entertainment to display. The feature in uDecide that will make choosing what to watch easier than any streaming services ability 
								will be its machine learning algorithm that recommends users what to watch based on previously collected user data. Some of this 
								user data may include things like previously watched entertainment, likes and dislikes built into uDecide, ratings given to watched 
								entertainment, preferred entertainment themes and categories, minimum rating for use to consider watching and many more.<br> 
								<br>
								When the user gets to a movie or shows listing on uDecide there will be a breadth of information about that individual page for the 
								user to consider when picking whether to watch said movie or show. A prominent piece of information that will be on every piece of 
								media is a rating from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. Gathering the IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes rating data will be achieved through the 
								likes of IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes free API's. Underneath the ratings section will be reviews that the user can then read if they 
								decide they want specific input from people who have already watched the movie or show. <br>
								<br>
								The planned catalogues that uDecide will support is so far planned but not limited to Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney Plus, 
								Stan, Paramount Plus, BINGE and Foxtel Now. Having all major streaming services used today is especially important for uDecide to 
								be popular as missing a streaming service means missing a large demographic of people who use that streaming service. In uDecide 
								you will be able to link your chosen streaming services not only through the signing up page but also in setting afterwards if you 
								sign up to more streaming services later down the line. <br>
								<br>
								uDecide's recommended movies and shows will be presented in a watch list format for the user to view on the home page or in an 
								expanded whole page format to view more options at once. These options will come from the machine learning algorithm and depending 
								on what the user is in the mood to watch can be customised beyond the machine learning algorithm with the users own manual 
								filtering. These two methods of listing movies merged allow the user to pick between only movies they will enjoy which removes 
								any sort of time wastage that is normally associated with finding a movie or show to watch on multiple different streaming services.<br> 
								<br>
								For every theme and category in uDecides catalogue will be a top 100 listing of the most popular movies or shows in that category 
								at that point in time. This allows you to pick from the cream of the crop movies or shows in that category across the world. The 
								source of this information will come from IMDB and sometimes other API's depending on what is needed. It will be contained on its 
								own page in a simple listed view with each movie listing bringing you to the details such as the description, ratings, reviews, 
								and trailers.<br>
								<br>
								The manual filters feature is common amongst almost all forms of video media searching because of how powerful the options can be. 
								On uDecide the settings will be relevant to its purpose and features such as streaming services and ratings. Streaming service 
								options will be in manual filters that allow you to choose which streaming services you want to see listings from. These streaming 
								services may be ones you are subscribed to, or you might even want to see options on services you are not currently subscribed to. 
								A classification setting will also be an option allowing you to choose between CTC, G, PG, M, MA 15+ and R 18+. Next is the classic 
								genre selection that will contain not only broader genres of movie such as horror and comedy but also combinations, for example 
								instead of having to pick between a horror and a comedy you can join them and only get listings of movies with both genres. You 
								will also be able to filter movies based on their IMDB score so that you can choose what quality of movie you are okay with 
								watching. Finally, there will be an actor search bar in case you want a movie with or without certain actors as well as an awards 
								filter.<br>
								<br>
								Moving on from the filter options, there is one more way to search through movies that being the simple search bar which can work 
								in tandem with the manual filters and recommendations pages. It will have its own page where it can be used as an individual tool 
								however as limiting the search bars usage to other forms of entertainment searching would limit its overall results in searching 
								different queries. The search bar will be for name's only as the manual filters take care of the rest of the users wants in movie 
								choice.<br>
								<br>
								In addition to the above features, uDecide will have one key element that will help provide entertainment recommendations for kids 
								as previously there has been none of that on almost all platforms. The kid's recommendation section will also be influenced by the 
								machine learning algorithm so that six-year old's and sixteen-year old's do not get the same movie and show recommendations. 
								Depending on a young kid's preference they may get "Paw Patrol" in their recommendations whereas a teenager might get an anime 
								like "The Seven Deadly Sins".
							</p>
							<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
							 	<p>
								For the Udecide program, it will require a variety of tools and technologies and programming languages
								and it is described in detail as below.</p>
								<div class="table-wrapper">
									<table class="alt">
										<tbody>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Programming Languages<b></td>
													<td><b>Java</b><br>
														Java will be an important language used mainly for backend in Udecide implementing heavy duty tasks.<br>
														<b>Python</b><br>
														Python will also be used as a language for backend like Java, and it will also be utilized for security.
														It will be operated to analyze security vulnerabilities and risk factors. In addition, it will be designed
														to provide specific contents for users by forming an algorithm for a specific target through AI of machine
														learning using Python.<br>
														<b>Node.js</b><br>
														Node.js will be used as a programming language for the client side and server. It will allow to be able to
														be debugablity as diagnostic tools and observability for metrics.<br>
														<b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript</b><br>
														HTML, CSS and JavaScript will be used for front end development to design an interactive website and applications
														(Ourtechroom.com, 2022).
													</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Tool Kit</b></td>
												<td>For the tool kit, Android studio for Android and Apple X code for iOS will be used to design an operating system
															based on IDEA software.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Media Format</b></td>
												<td>Udecide will support various media formats such as MKV, MP4, AVCHD, AVI, DMW, MOV, FLV, WMV, SWF to play video
													(Ourtechroom.com, 2022).</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Cloud Services</b></td>
												<td>Udecide will use Amazon Web Service (UWS) to manage storage, process data, and efficiently support video viewing with high speed.</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Steaming Protocols</b></td>
												<td>HTTP Live streaming protocol will be used to communicate with iOS and it will distribute files to Apple devices.
														Adobe's HTTP Dynamic Streaming will be utilized for workflows for encoding video.
														Microsoft's Silverlight Smooth Streaming will be operated to minimize buffering and start-up time quickly to provide streaming
														in real-time basis (Barry and Crowley, 2022).</td>
											</tr>
											<tr>
												<td><b>Hardware Requirements</b></td>
												<td>In terms of hardware development, as it will require handling a lot of data to process so a Linux based server would be
													recommended on Udecide program such as Intel® Xeon® E-2286G processor with 256GB RAM, 12 USB 3.0 ports, motherboard
													with two cooling fans and one cabinet fan, with four network ports (each 1Gpbs per port) (Ankesh Anand 2020).</td>

							<h3>Skills Required</h3>
							<p>
								There are a variety of skills needed for uDecide to function. These skills vary from general team and project management type skills
								 to ensure people work as an effective team and the app is developed in an efficient and high-quality manner, to highly technical 
								 skills like machine learning with Python that may require multiple people to have specialized experience in just to implement the 
								 related features correctly.<br>
								<br>
								Project Management<br>
								<br>
								Project Management is an extremely important for uDecide because it will act as the glue that brings everyone's skills together so 
								that we can first plan out how we are going develop uDecide in a time conscious manner while also making sure that the final product 
								will be of commercial quality. Good project management will also be the skill necessary for making sure the teams' skills are put to 
								beneficial use and minimising the amount of wasted effort that will go into the project.<br>
								<br>
								Web Development<br>
								<br>
								uDecide's web platform will require people with good web development skills both front end and back end so that the website functions 
								correctly with minimal bugs and latency so that customers have good experiences and keep using uDecide. Web development contains 
								multiple individual skills of their own that all glue together to make up web applications. On the front end or user experience side 
								there is HTML, CSS, and JavaScript while the back end has multiple options, a couple of those options are C# or like the front end 
								you can use JavaScript but in a separate way.<br>
								<br>
								App Development<br>
								<br>
								The second main platform uDecide will be created for is Mobile. The mobile app itself will be as similar as possible to website so 
								that it is recognisable except it will be designed around the mobile user experience as opposed to viewing the website on a large 
								monitor. Universal Stream Solution LLC (2020) It is also possible to share a back end between an app and a website which removes 
								that part of the development process from the app's creation. Like web development, app development contains many individual skills 
								except it is a much larger pool of skills because you only need to pick the skills you think will work best for your app instead of 
								needing almost all of them.<br>
								<br>
								Design Skills<br>
								<br>
								To make sure that uDecide's website and app is not only functional but also a comfortable experience for the end user, people with 
								clever design skills will be needed. The design of the website comes down to two main things, UI (User Interface) and UX (User 
								Experience). UI is the look of the website, meaning the assets used for things like logos, buttons, and others but it also includes 
								making sure the look of the app is comfortable for the end user and is not a bunch of undecipherable rainbow text. Emil Lamprecht 
								(2022) Next is UX which is about the functionality and usability of the app for the end user. This includes things like making sure 
								an apps settings section is easy to navigate even for the tech inexperienced. Both these things make up design as a whole and are 
								equally important for the end users experience.<br>
								<br>
								Machine Learning<br>
								<br>
								uDecide's star and arguable hardest to implement feature is its ability to predict and provide the end user with recommendations 
								that tick all the boxes for their idea of a good movie using machine learning. Machine learning is commonly associated with the 
								Python programming language because of its easy usability which has led to its large support network from machine learning experts 
								and enthusiasts today. IBM Cloud Computing (2020) Being good at machine learning requires experience with at least most of its sub 
								fields like deep learning and neural networks. The way machine learning will predict and recommend the end user these personally 
								tailored movie options is through the vigorous consumption of substantial amounts of data about the user. This large quantity of 
								data will then be used to try and predict the users desired movie and then refine this process by repeating it with slightly 
								different variable until it reaches a level the user can rely on.<br>
								<br>
								Data Skills<br>
								<br>
								Experience with handling substantial amounts of data and being able to easily use that data in some form of application development 
								is one of the most important skills to make uDecide's machine learning feature work. The core of any machine learning algorithm is 
								the data it uses to refine that algorithm to something useable. In this case we need someone good with handling not only regular 
								data but specifically user data so that we know what we need to collect and what is not required for the machine learning algorithm 
								to create its predictions and recommendations for a human.<br>
								<br>
								Hardware Skills<br>
								<br>
								With any form of software, in this case web and mobile there is a physical piece of hardware it is being stored on. Therefore, being 
								able to manage this hardware is a skill uDecide needs to function. These hardware skills will be put to best use when storing the 
								user data that is being used for the machine learning algorithm. In the beginning stages of uDecide the data stored will not be that 
								large but if you start getting lots of users that small amount of data quickly multiplies and you need to be able to scale up 
								effectively, especially in the hardware department as with lots more users come lots more data to store.<br>
								<br>
								Testing Skills<br>
								<br>
								Testing is just as important a skill for uDecide as programming the actual application is. With multiple features like different 
								recommendations, settings, and design features that all need to flow and work together seamlessly, there is bound to be bugs, 
								optimisation issues and a complete break of the website at multiple stages during uDecide's development. To ensure these problems 
								are removed as soon as they pop up, we will need to constantly test every feature of the website and mobile app so that we can 
								quickly implement fixes and keep the applications healthy and running.<br>
								<br>
								DevOps Skills<br>
								<br>
								In software development you must be able to work as an efficient team that can work together to roll out new features with little to 
								no delay from differing groups and fields of work. For this to be achieved all members of a team must have good DevOps skill so that 
								there is no wasted effort between trying to merge distinct groups work who have not discussed what they are developing properly for 
								weeks or even months. Andrea Crawford (2019) Having a DevOps fluency throughout the team means being able to create complex plans 
								that account for all groups in a team so that workflows join seamlessly rather than trying to merge their incompatible work at the 
								end of the development effort. From deployment on a good DevOps team must also be able to generate and integrate a continuous 
								feedback loop from end users, to developers, to quality assurance testers and back to the end user's product.<br>
								<br>
								uDecide is very much feasible as everything that the web application and mobile app required has tangible tools and resources that 
								have been used and refined extensively for years beforehand. Creating a website or mobile app is no hurdle in such a large website 
								and app ecosystem with hundreds of ways to create one thing. The information that needs to be accessed from third parties is also 
								easily accessible like IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes ratings as there are multiple API's that give free access to the required data. The 
								machine learning algorithm that will predict and recommend the user movies is just a matter of learning how to create it through 
								the multitude of online resources available today. The challenge we face currently is linking streaming services to our app as we do 
								not know of a way to do so yet, it is however a feature on other applications which means we must find out how it is done.
							</p>
							<h3>Outcome</h3>
							<p>
								uDecide will be shipped in phases for efficiency and evaluation purposes. A phased release schedule allows more time to flesh out 
								features that need the most work while still getting a shipped and working product sent out for people to use. We are also able to 
								evaluate the state of the project between phases and see what needs or doesn't need to be changed so that the project can be in it's
								best state. Another advantage to phases is that they do not interrupt a regular development workflow because the first phase will 
								be base features of uDecide that features in phase 2 onward need to be developed to actually be useable in the website and mobile 
								app.<br>
								<br>
								Phase one is currently the focus so phase two and three will be planned out later. Phase one will consist of the websites core 
								features ensuring its base usability and functionality come first before adding more complex things like machine learning. The first 
								aspect of creating uDecides website will be creating a static HTML/CSS page with multiple pages for different sections of the website. 
								The first section will need to be a login page which allows users to sign up to the service. Following the login page will be the main 
								content which will have listings of movies and tv shows across multiple different streaming services that you can navigate through 
								with manual filters. On each movie and tv show there will be an IMDB rating displayed so that the user knows how good the movie is. 
								The IMDB rating will also be part of the manual filters so that you can choose how good you want your chosen movie or tv show will be. 
								The other pages of the site will consist of different categories or sub sections for movies and tv shows. These categories include 
								things like action, horror and comedy to name a few.<br>
								<br>
								If uDecide is successful then almost everyone who enjoys watching movies and shows on streaming services will be using uDecide to 
								cater to their needs and choices of movie. There will be accurate recommendations personalized for each users tastes in entertainment, 
								including different age ranges mainly amongst younger people. uDecide will also have in depth reviews and ratings from multiple 
								sources for each piece of media it lists so that the user can see what people thought of the movie before deciding to watch it. 
								People will no longer need to spend as much time thinking about what to watch which can be frustrating in a group, instead they 
								can now relax knowing uDecide will give them something good to watch.<br>
