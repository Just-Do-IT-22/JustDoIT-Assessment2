                <p>
                    Philip: Alright, hi this is Philip Porte I'm interviewing Biagio Abignagno senior engineering manager for Bright. I'll start with my first question. Please tell me about your IT work. What exactly do you do?<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: So I'm an engineering manager for a fintech that means I manage a team of five engineers, mix of seniors to juniors. Theres a contract there as well. So my main focus is three areas, delivery of software, the second area is a career path think education and tooling for the software engineers so making sure they've got the right tools of the trade they're trained up, they're educated, they're learning and third is also our engineering process. So how we manage our environments, how we test, how we ship good quality code and general health of the overall team. So if I was to give it in another summary it would be I provide, I'm supposed to provide the correct highly trained, highly skilled, well taught engineers, to the company and this team of engineers are supposed to be able to deliver high quality software. If they don't then thats where I have to come in and help with support.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Cool, thanks. For the next question can you please tell me about the industry you work in.<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: Oh so the industry is fintech or financial technology so what that means is that we use technology to help accelerate the financial business. So our core product is buy now pay later. If you've heard of like afterpay or zip, we're very similar to them but we use buy now pay later for sustainable green home improvement. So our goal is to make every home in Australia sustainable, so we provide targetted loans for sustainable home improvement to the areas of solar panels, batteries, electric vehicles, heat pumps. Pretty much anything that you can do to improve your home to make it sustainable. We specialize in finance for those. The way we make our money is that we charge whats called a vendor certainty fee. So the vendor, the person who installs the solar panels will go to the house, they'll say right home owner, I can install solar panels. It'll cost you ten thousand dollars cash today, or you can get financing through Bright. If they choose the financing through Bright option, we pay the vendor the ten thousand dollars directly, but then we take over the loan with the home owner. That's how we make our money.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Alright, cool, thanks. What other kinds of work do you have to do for your job?<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: What other kind of work, so I have to respond to incidents, so if our software systems go down or theres a wide spread sort of outage I need to manage incidents and make sure that we recover correctly. Also communicate with wider parts of the business. I have to do a lot of recruitment, so I have to do a lot of interviews to make sure that we hire the right people. Interviewings hard because you only spend like an hour and a half with someone but this person could be spending a long time with you so I've go to put a lot of focus on interviewing. Training as well and just a lot of extra curricular things like our engineering process that sort of I fit to my day. Oh sorry there is one thing I do manage our technical support. So we have three levels of support, first level, when a customer has an issue and they call up our customer support team is first level. Then we have an escalation, we have a slightly more technical team called L2. Then we have a team of engineers on call called L3 so I manage the L3 engineers as well. So anything that requires a code change in terms of customer support will come to my team as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Alright, cool. Who are all the different people you interact with in your work?<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: Oh so I've got my team of developers, I've also got my product manager. So the product manager and me are a partnership, so we direct the stream of work that comes in to the team. I've also got my boss head of engineering. He dictates like the overall direction that our engineering department or culture should take. I also interact a lot with our supprt teams as well so if we have a lot of. If we have a lot of support issues with a certain piece of software, that could be a sign that software is unhealthy so I need to then feed that back into the teams to get that fixed because part of good software is that it operates correctly so thats a part of it too. I also interact with our TA team, talent acquisition team, all the recuiters. So we have a small team of internal recruiters and they manage the candidates as they come in for interviews so I interact with them quite a lot. Yeah salary negotiations, offers, I can red flag people say don't hire them etc. The other people I work with is P&C so people and culture which is a fancy name for HR. Any questions or any issues I have in terms of peoples direct employment with the company that I can't handle I'll escalate to P&C and they help me out as well.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Cool, can you tell me about your interactions with other IT professionals?<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: Yeah so I have a peer group of other engineering managers at work so they each have their own team as well, we don't interact on the day to day but we catch up maybe once a week just to keep in line keep sync and make sure that we're running our teams in similar ways. I also interact sometimes with a lot of people in other industries over linkedln, over meet ups on occasion too. I actually do keep in touch with a lot of ex colleagues that are also in the same industry as me, we tend to go in the same circles every now and then I'll have a coffee catch up with an ex colleague and just see how they're going. Sometimes if we need a job we can help each other out. I also still give a quite a lot of referals so I've got a lot of ex staff members that when they need a job they'll call me and say hey I've got a job. Sorry I have a job offer I need a referal can you be my referal so I'll do several of those a year and thats just because I've had so many engineers report to me over the years.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Yeah, alright. What about your interactions with clients or investors?<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: Ohh I don't have any interactions with investors in my current job but I do interact with clients or with users to a degree so sometimes when they're having issues it's not clear so I need to basically go direct to customer support and find out what the issue is, but software engineers and myself don't talk directly to customers however we do get their feedback. So we do that in a couple of ways, we can, we're able to playback customer support calls, we're allowed to do that. So if the customer is having issue with our software we can hear phone calls of them. This way so we can hear the feed back directly from the customer. We use some screen recording, sorry, we use some software that records user interface journeys called hot jar. So for example when a customer interacts with our software online every now and then the screen journey is recorded so we're able to actually to see how users play with or interact with our software so we can see where they get stuck, how fast they get through certain screens. So like a lot of our client sort of interaction is that we see a lot of their activity, but that activity is recorded in some form.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Alright, cool. When it comes to your work what aspects of it do you spend the most time on?<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: Oh, the delivery. So whenever we have some piece or some new feature to deliver I'm basically the default or defacto like master for the team so I've gotta get, so product comes to me and says heres the thing we gotta build for the customers heres why, I'll work with the engineers to break it down into individual sorta tickets. Those tickets then get estimated and it's my job to plan out what engineers we need, how long it's gonna take and then I do something called I push the tickets so we have daily stand up and I make sure the tickets go from ready for dev, to in development, in testing, to relesed. So I basically just, I'm like the coach or support person to make sure that everybodys getting through the tickets in a reasonable amount of time so we hit our deliverable targets. If people get stuck or they get blocked on a ticket. Blocked means your waiting for something outside of your control and you can't progress on the ticket I'll help get that resolved and get that sort of unblocked. Whether thats you need to work with another team or we need to talk to another subject matter expert to get a decision made.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Alright, is that also the aspect of work you find the most challenging or is there one that's harder then that?<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: Oh god, no the aspect of work I find the most challenging is getting everyone in the engineering department making sure we're all on the same page. That can be really challenging now that we're all remote. For example I can have a certain style but if that certain style doesn't match up with other parts of the business it can cause issues where we're not aligned on our engineering practice, it can create silo's which is not great. So the most challenging part is how I make sure that my engineers have enough interactions with all the other engineers so we're all operating as one engineering department with common goals, common processes, common understandings. That's very challenging now that we're remote but yeah.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Cool, finally can you share an example of the work you do that best captures the essence of the IT industry?<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: Share an example? <br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Yeah.<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: Oh, yeah so a good example is one stream of work that I'm helping facilitate now is our instant response, so we serve quite a few customers and we have quite a lot of people who rely on our software being up. The company I work for currently is in scale up mode, so what scale up mode means was that we were a start up, we now have a successful product, we're now trying to scale that out to more users but as we scale the deficiencies in the software system become apparent in terms of being able to scale properly, bugs, edge cases that were edge cases when we had a small amount of users now become problems we have with a large amount of users. So our internet response is something we're trying to work at right now, as we have more users we have, we can have the potential for more incidents. When an incident with software happens we need to make sure we get the right people, in the right room, at the right time to push forward to a resolution really quickly. We also need to communicate out to the wider business the status so we've detected an issue, the issues affecting these services, it's affecting our end users in this manner, we're working on the fix and then I'll provide regular status updates. When the incident is resolved or we've provided a software fix I'll then communicate back to the wider business over what the impact was, any financial impact and what communication we can give out to customers. So it's trying to work on how we respond corretly when things go wrong. Getting the right people in the right room is challengin when we're all remote as well because we're not in the office, we're all spread out over sydney and some people in melbourne. So thats a challenging thing I'm working on now so it's a sign of success in the industry. So when you're a start up and you've got like two or three people using your software and you've got an incident you don't really care that much, but when you hit success and you start scaling up and you get a lot lot more users then you're incident response becomes very very important because it maintains the health and quality of your software for your users and no one wants to use a piece of software thats continually breaking, it's not fun. So that's a very common challenge in the industry how you scale up effectively.<br>
                    <br>
                    Philip: Cool, Alright, That's it. Thank you so much for taking the time to do this interview.<br>
                    <br>
                    Biagio: You're welcome Philip.
